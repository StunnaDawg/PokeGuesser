## Description
PokeGuesser is Pokemon Guessing game built using TypeScript, React, and Firebase/Firestore. Using [pokenode.ts](https://github.com/Gabb-c/pokenode-ts) to fetch all Pokemon name and spirtes, the players objective is to get as many Pokemon names in a row, this is called Classic Mode. In future updates there will be different difficulties, generation specific modes, and timed modes.
